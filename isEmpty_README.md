#Function Purpose:
- The function is named isEmpty.
- It is designed to check if a given value is considered empty across various data types.
Parameters:
- The function takes a single parameter named value, representing the value to be checked for emptiness.
Return Type:
- The function returns a boolean value (true if the value is empty, false otherwise).
Conditions for Empty Value:

- Checks if the value is undefined.
- Checks if the value is null.
- Checks if the value is an empty string ('').
- Checks if the value is a boolean and is false.
- Checks if the value is a number and is 0.
- Checks if the value is an array and has a length of 0.
- Checks if the value is an object and has no keys (i.e., an empty object).
- Logical OR (||) Operator:
  
- The conditions are combined using the logical OR (||) operator.
- If any of these conditions are true, the function returns true, indicating an empty value.

  
#Usage Example:
Developers can use this function to quickly check whether a variable has any meaningful content or is considered empty.

#Note:
The function may not cover all edge cases based on specific application requirements. For example, it considers an empty array and an object with no keys as empty, but this might vary based on the use case.

#Export Statement:
The function is exported using the export keyword, making it accessible to other modules.
This isEmpty function is versatile and can be used in scenarios where different data types need to be checked for emptiness in a concise manner. Developers can leverage this utility to enhance code readability and reduce redundancy when handling empty values across different types.
